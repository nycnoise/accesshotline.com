# access hotline

Access Hotline will eventually provide hella resources for finding accessible spaces & describing access in venues (including sample language, translations, & more)––but first **we need to find out what information venues provide, what help venues need, & what resources & expertise can be contributed by the community.**

## VENUES

Please fill out the short **[venue form](https://tally.so/r/KYzMGg)** to submit your venue's access links or to request help describing your space.


## VOLUNTEERS

Fill out the short **[volunteer form](https://tally.so/r/68LMyk)** to help out. Disabled music lovers, folks with language skills, programmers, designers, print shop hookups all welcome; let us know how you can help out! (The goal is to get enough funding to compensate disabled consultants; we're working on it!)
