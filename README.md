# access hotline

Access Hotline will eventually provide hella resources for finding accessible spaces & describing access in venues (including sample language, translations, & more)––but first we need to find out **what information venues are providing, what help venues need, & what resources & expertise might be contributed by the community.**

## VENUES

Fill out this **[short form](https://tally.so/r/KYzMGg)** to submit your venue's access links or to ask for help describing accessibility in your space.


## VOLUNTEERS

Fill out this **[short form](https://tally.so/r/68LMyk)** to volunteer to help out. Disabled music lovers, folks with language skills, programmers, designers, print shop hookups all welcome; let us know where you can help out! (Goal is to get enough funding to compensate disabled consultants, but it may take a bit...)
