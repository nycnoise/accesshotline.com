# access hotline

access hotline will eventually provide hella resources for describing access in your space, including sample language, translations, & more... but first we need to find out what help venues need & who is interested in helping out!

## VENUES

Fill out this [short form](https://tally.so/r/KYzMGg) to submit your venue's access links or to ask for help describing accessibility in your space.


## VOLUNTEERS

Fill out this [short form](https://tally.so/r/68LMyk) to volunteer to help out. Disabled music lovers, folks with language skills, programmers, designers, print shop hookups, all wellcome!! (Goal is to get enough funding to compensate disabled consultants, but it may take a bit...)
